## Course Project Codebook

The measure variables underpinning this dataset are described in full detail in the dataset's "features.txt" file.
The naming convention was simplified for the purposes of the Coursera Course Project. The simplified syntax as seen in the current dataset are as follows:

* Prefix (first letter): t=Time or f=Frequency Domain Signals
* Acceleration signals (see second and third letter(s)): B=Body; BB=BodyBody; G=Gravity
* Additional features: Acc=Accelerometer; Gyro=Gyroscope; Jerk=Jerk; Mag=Magnitude
* Estimation type: M=Mean value; S=Standard Deviation
* Suffix: .X, .Y, and .Z denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions

Non-measure variables include "Subject" and "Activity Label"
* Subject: denotes subject performing activities (30 volunteers ages 19-48)
* ActivityLabel: denotes type of activity performed by each subject  (1-6)
-- 1 WALKING
-- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
-- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
-- 4 SITTING
-- 5 STANDING
-- 6 LAYING

The origianl dataset included a variety of summary statistics; this dataset extracted only variables calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation of the original dataset (denoted by the "Measure Features").
This dataset calculated the mean value of each of this subset dataset by Subject and Activity (denoted by Activity Label).
